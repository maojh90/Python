双斜杠自动取整 %取余数 双星号代表次方 变量可以直接指定
string必须加单引号或者双引号 不加引号就是变量  quotes引用
"I don't think she is 18"  "she said :"I love you""
'I don\'t think she is 18'
print("hey now cow") 
print('c:\Desktop\nude') is wrong, because  "\n" means newline 
and the right code is : print(r'c:\Desktop\nude')
we can also assign a var to string    and  the var can plus a new string  like:  var+"black"
